So, why would we use a VPN to begin with?
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
There are three main reasons as to why you should consider using a VPN and those three reasons being:                                                                                               1. Privacy: To keep what you're doing on the internet private, making sure your data is safe and out of harmsway                                                                                      2. Security: To protect personal data, especially on public networks                               3.

First step:                                                                                          From within my own machine through Microsoft Azure I created a resource group and a Windows 10 virtual machine in another geographic location (Red circle). To identify whether or noth the VPN is effective or not.

Second Step:                                                                                         I deployed the VM that's in another geographic location and browsed to https://whatismyipaddress.com/ to identify the IPv4 address (Red Circle) before the launch of the VPN.

Third Step:                                                                                           After installing a secure VPN from "https://account.protonvpn.com/signup?plan=free&language=en" I created an account and activated the VPN and randomly selected another geographic location (Red Circle) to track the change in the IPv4 address.
